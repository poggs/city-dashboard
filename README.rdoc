* Harriet Walsh - @wa1shie
* Tom Forth - @thomasforth
* Peter Hicks - @poggs
* Hannah Draper

== What?

A Ruby on Rails application, hastily cobbled together with coffee, absolutely no testing and little optimisation.  You can probably run it locally if you know how to set up a Rails application, or you can have a look at http://city-dashboard.poggs.co.uk:8081/ (or if that doesn't work, http://city-dashboard.poggs.co.uk/)
